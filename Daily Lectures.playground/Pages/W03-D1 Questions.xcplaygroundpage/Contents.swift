//      Question: Can an array be included into a let statement?
let myArray: [Int] = [1, 2, 3]

//      Question: Can you show us an example of where, in our previous exercises, we could have implemented the print(_:separator:terminator:) function?
print("one", 2, "Tree")
print("one", 2, "Tree", "for", "HIVE", separator: " and ")
print("one", 2, "Tree", terminator: "!!!!!!!!\n")
print("one", 2, "Tree", separator: " and ", terminator: " Oh Yeah!\n")

//      Question: Would I use UInt when I want the absolute value of the Int without knowing if the number is positive or negative?

let originalInt: Int = -4352423423
let naivelyFlipped = UInt(bitPattern: originalInt)

// This is a comment example

//: Example for constant
let dog = "dog" // String
let dogNumber = 3 // Int
